        <div>       
            Twinkle, twinkle, little star,
            How I wonder what you are!
            Up above the world so high,
            Like a diamond in the sky  <br> <hr> <br>
            
            When the blazing sun is gone,
            When he nothing shines upon,
            Then you show your little light,
            Twinkle, twinkle, all the night. <br> <hr> <br>
            
            Then the traveler in the dark
            Thanks you for your tiny spark,
            How could he see where to go,
            If you did not twinkle so?  <br><hr> <br>
            
            In the dark blue sky you keep,
            Often through my curtains peep
            For you never shut your eye,
            Till the sun is in the sky. <br><hr><br>
            
            As your bright and tiny spark
            Lights the traveler in the dark,
            Though I know not what you are,
            Twinkle, twinkle, little star. <br><hr> <br>
